        The rise of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT, has sparked both excitement and
        profound <strong>21</strong> across various sectors. While many hail AI as a powerful tool for boosting
        efficiency and innovation, others express deep <strong>22</strong> about its ethical implications. For creative
        professionals, the debate centers on whether AI-generated art and writing should be afforded the same
        intellectual property <strong>23</strong> as human-made works. The core issue is that AI models are trained on
        vast datasets of human content, raising questions about whether they are merely synthesizing existing material
        or truly capable of <strong>24</strong> new concepts. Furthermore, the rapid adoption of AI is predicted to
        cause widespread <strong>25</strong> in the labor market, potentially replacing jobs that rely on routine
        cognitive tasks.
        <br><br>
        However, the technology's proponents emphasize its potential to serve as a revolutionary <strong>26</strong> to
        human creativity. For example, AI can analyze complex data far faster than humans, enabling researchers to
        quickly process information and focus on high-level problem-solving. This shift allows human workers to pivot
        toward roles requiring critical thinking, emotional intelligence, and interpersonal <strong>27</strong>—skills
        that remain uniquely human. To effectively harness AI's power, educators and policymakers must develop new
        guidelines to ensure its responsible <strong>28</strong> in classrooms and workplaces. Ultimately, AI should be
        viewed not as a replacement for human intellect, but as a powerful mechanism to <strong>29</strong> and expand
        human capabilities, helping us to achieve goals that were <strong>30</strong> thought impossible.

        <strong>Urban Sprawl and Smart Growth</strong><br><br>
        Urban sprawl, characterized by low-density residential and commercial development outside city centers, has led
        to numerous environmental and social problems. These include increased traffic congestion, reliance on vehicles,
        and loss of farmlands. To counteract these effects, urban planners are increasingly advocating for "smart
        growth" strategies. <strong>31. ____</strong> This approach aims to create compact, walkable communities that
        mix residential and commercial uses.
        <br><br>
        A key component of smart growth is Transit-Oriented Development (TOD). TOD focuses on maximizing residential and
        business space within walking distance of public transport. <strong>32. ____</strong> Residents near TOD hubs
        are thus less reliant on cars, leading to a reduction in carbon emissions and fuel consumption. This model also
        addresses social equity by making affordable housing and job opportunities accessible to a wider range of the
        population.
        <br><br>
        <strong>33. ____</strong> They ensure that new buildings are designed to be energy-efficient and that permeable
        paving is used to manage stormwater runoff, preventing local flooding. Furthermore, planners actively integrate
        green spaces and parks into high-density areas, improving air quality and providing residents with recreational
        opportunities.
        <br><br>
        Critics, however, sometimes worry that densification might lead to loss of community identity or overcrowding.
        <strong>34. ____</strong> By balancing growth with environmental stewardship and community engagement, smart
        growth offers a blueprint for creating vibrant, economically sound, and sustainable urban areas for the future.
    </div>

    <p><strong>選項：</strong></p>
    <p>(A) Smart growth involves land-use planning that encourages compact, mixed-use areas and preserves open space.
    </p>
    <p>(B) Therefore, policymakers must implement robust community engagement strategies to address these concerns and
        maintain quality of life.</p>
    <p>(C) TOD projects often involve the construction of mixed-use buildings, incorporating offices, retail, and homes
        in a concentrated area.</p>
    <p>(D) Smart growth also places a high priority on environmental sustainability through various design principles.

    <h2>五、閱讀測驗 (24分)</h2>

    <h3>第35-38題組：The Hidden Power of Mind-Wandering</h3>
    <div class="passage">
        For decades, scientists viewed mind-wandering—when our attention drifts away from the task at hand toward
        unrelated thoughts—as a sign of distraction or poor concentration. However, recent cognitive science research
        suggests that these involuntary mental detours are not merely unproductive noise but a crucial aspect of
        high-level cognitive function. Mind-wandering, often occurring during mundane or repetitive tasks, activates the
        brain's Default Mode Network (DMN), a set of interconnected regions previously thought to be "resting."
        <br><br>
        Far from resting, the DMN is highly active during these lapses in attention, engaging in complex work such as
        future planning, self-reflection, and problem incubation. When the mind wanders, it frequently simulates
        potential future scenarios, allowing us to mentally prepare for various outcomes, a function known as
        "prospective bias." This suggests that a wandering mind is actually a mind preparing for the future, rather than
        escaping the present.
        <br><br>
        Furthermore, mind-wandering is strongly linked to creativity. Studies show that individuals whose minds wander
        frequently tend to perform better on tasks requiring divergent thinking—the ability to generate multiple
        solutions to a single problem. By stepping away from the constraints of a specific problem, the DMN is able to
        draw upon diffuse memories and concepts, allowing for novel combinations of ideas. Thus, the deliberate
        inclusion of "cognitive breaks" into demanding schedules—allowing the mind to wander freely—is now considered a
        valuable strategy for enhancing innovation and solving complex issues that require synthesized thinking.

    <h3>第39-42題組：Global Food Systems and the Rise of Vertical Farming</h3>
    <div class="passage">
        The future of food security faces unprecedented challenges due to climate change, decreasing arable land, and
        rapid urbanization. In response, a revolutionary agricultural technique known as vertical farming is gaining
        global traction. Vertical farms cultivate crops in vertically stacked layers within a controlled indoor
        environment, typically utilizing LED lighting and hydroponic or aeroponic systems instead of soil.
        <br><br>
        One of the most significant advantages of vertical farming is its minimal environmental footprint. These farms
        use up to 95% less water than traditional field farming because water is recycled constantly within the closed
        system. Furthermore, since they are often established in urban centers, they drastically reduce the "food
        miles"—the distance food travels from farm to consumer—thereby lowering transportation-related carbon emissions
        and ensuring fresher produce. By eliminating outdoor variables, vertical farming also bypasses the need for
        pesticides, offering consumers cleaner, safer crops year-round, regardless of external weather conditions.
        <br><br>
        Despite these clear benefits, vertical farming faces economic and technological hurdles. The initial investment
        required for constructing and maintaining a vertical farm, particularly the energy costs associated with
        powerful LED lighting and climate control, remains extremely high. Currently, this model is most cost-effective
        for high-value, fast-growing crops like leafy greens and herbs. For staple crops like wheat or rice, the energy
        cost per calorie produced is still prohibitive. However, as renewable energy technologies advance and the
        efficiency of LED lighting continues to improve, experts predict that vertical farming will become an
        indispensable component of sustainable, resilient urban food systems.

    <h3>第43-46題組：The Evolving Role of the Public Library</h3>
    <div class="passage">
        The public library, once primarily a repository of printed books, is undergoing a profound transformation to
        remain relevant in the digital age. Facing competition from online resources and commercial streaming services,
        modern libraries are redefining their mission, shifting from being merely a place to borrow materials to
        becoming dynamic community centers for learning, technology access, and cultural engagement.
        <br><br>
        This evolution is most evident in the services libraries now offer. Beyond physical books, they provide
        extensive digital collections, including e-books, audiobooks, and streaming movies. Crucially, they serve as
        vital technology hubs. For individuals lacking home internet or computers—a problem known as the "digital
        divide"—libraries offer free Wi-Fi, computer workstations, and essential digital literacy workshops. They are
        often the only place where marginalized populations can apply for jobs, access governmental services, or attend
        virtual classes.
        <br><br>
        Furthermore, many libraries have expanded into "makerspaces" or creative labs, equipped with 3D printers, laser
        cutters, and professional recording equipment. These spaces democratize access to expensive technology, enabling
        patrons to experiment, innovate, and develop marketable skills without significant financial outlay. Libraries
        also host a diverse range of programs, from youth coding clubs and language exchange groups to health and
        wellness seminars, fostering social cohesion and providing a neutral space for civic dialogue. In essence, the
        modern library functions as a dynamic, responsive institution that addresses the contemporary information and
        social needs of its diverse community members, ensuring that access to knowledge and opportunity remains
        universal.

        (A) <strong>Sarah:</strong> I found the morning "Focus Flow" track really helpful. It's structured perfectly to
        block out distractions, unlike simply listening to ambient music. The only thing is, the subscription price is
        steep. I wish there was a more flexible, perhaps hourly, payment option.
        <br><br>
        (B) <strong>Mark:</strong> I signed up hoping it would solve my afternoon slump, but the daily reminder
        notifications felt overwhelming, almost anxiety-inducing. I wanted mindfulness, not another demanding app on my
        phone. The content itself was alright, but the delivery needs serious adjustment.
        <br><br>
        (C) <strong>Leo:</strong> I'm a student, so the price is definitely a barrier. However, my friend who works in
        finance swears by the "Burnout Buster" modules. He says it's genuinely improved his sleep quality and sense of
        control during high-stress periods.
        <br><br>
        (D) <strong>Jessica:</strong> I love the variety. The ability to customize guides based on whether I'm tackling
        a creative task or deep analytical work is fantastic. For me, the cost is justifiable because it replaces two
        separate apps I used to pay for—one for meditation and one for background noise.
        <br><br>
        (E) <strong>Alex:</strong> The content felt too generic. I prefer guided sessions that are more specific to my
        industry's pressures. It sounds like something that was quickly generated using an AI script rather than
        genuinely curated by human experts. I canceled after the free trial.
        <br><br>
        (F) <strong>Emily:</strong> I found the "Sleep Stories" ineffective. I kept waiting for the plot twist! But
        seriously, I appreciate the overall intention, especially the clean, ad-free interface. It's definitely a strong
        contender in the self-help subscription market.
